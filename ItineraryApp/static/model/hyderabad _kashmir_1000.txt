Okay, here's a detailed trip plan from Hyderabad to Kashmir for a mix of historical sightseeing, cultural experiences, and delicious food, keeping in mind a budget of $1000 (approximately ₹83,000 INR).  This plan prioritizes budget-friendly choices while trying to maximize your experience.

**Important Notes Before You Start:**

*   **Currency Conversion:**  I'm using an approximate exchange rate of $1 = ₹83 INR.  This can fluctuate, so keep an eye on it.

Traveling in winter is possible but requires significantly different preparation due to snow and colder temperatures, increasing costs.  This itinerary *does not* cover winter travel.
*   **Flexibility:**  This is a *suggested* itinerary. Be prepared to adjust based on availability and your personal preferences. Book hotels and flights as early as possible for the best prices.
*   **Bargaining:**  Bargaining is common in Kashmir, especially in markets and for souvenirs.
*   **Safety:**  Check the latest travel advisories before you go. While tourism is generally safe, it's always prudent to be informed.
