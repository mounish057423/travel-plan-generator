Okay, planning a trip from India to the USA with a $2000 budget is challenging, but achievable with careful planning and a focus on budget-friendly options. This itinerary will prioritize affordable choices for flights, accommodation, and activities while incorporating your interests in history, culture, and food.

**Important Considerations Before We Start:**

*   **$2000 is *very* tight:**  This budget will realistically only cover *one person* for a shorter trip (around 7-10 days). It's going to require extreme frugality, flexibility with travel dates, and potentially sacrificing some desired experiences.
*   **Location:**  The USA is vast.  This itinerary will focus on **New York City**.  NYC, while expensive, has a ton of free/low-cost activities.  Visiting other parts of the US will likely require significant internal travel expenses and be difficult within this budget.
*   **Time of Year:**  Travel during the off-season (late fall, winter - excluding holidays, early spring) will be significantly cheaper for flights and accommodation.  Summer is the most expensive.
*   **Visa:**  Ensure you have a valid US visa (B1/B2 tourist visa).  The visa application process has its own fees and timelines, so factor that in.  We will NOT include visa fees in the $2000 budget.
*   **Flexibility:** Be prepared to adjust the itinerary on the go. Deals can appear, and weather can impact plans.
*   **DIY:** This plan relies heavily on you doing the research, booking, and planning yourself. Using a travel agent will add to the cost.

**Assumptions:**

*   Single Traveler
*   Travel dates are flexible (off-season preferred).
*   You're willing to stay in hostels or budget hotels.
*   You're comfortable using public transportation.
*   You're willing to cook some of your own meals or eat affordably.
