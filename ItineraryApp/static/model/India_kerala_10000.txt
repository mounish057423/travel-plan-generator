Okay, here's a detailed trip plan for a trip from India to Kerala, catering to your interest in history, culture, food, and using a mix of travel websites/platforms, all within a $10,000 budget.  This plan assumes you're already *in* India and traveling *to* Kerala.  If you're flying from *outside* India, the flight portion of the budget will need significant adjustment (and likely a reduction in the length of stay or luxury level).

**Assumptions:**

*   **Currency:**  All prices are in USD unless otherwise specified.
*   **Budget Allocation:** A flexible allocation.  Luxury experiences can be adjusted for budget constraints.
*   **Travel Style:** A balance of comfort and cultural immersion.
*   **Party Size:** Assumed to be 2 people.  Solo travel would significantly impact hotel costs. Larger groups would likely require more budget.
*   **Travel Time:** 10 days/9 nights in Kerala.

**Phase 1: Pre-Trip Planning & Booking (Before Leaving Your Starting Point in India)**
