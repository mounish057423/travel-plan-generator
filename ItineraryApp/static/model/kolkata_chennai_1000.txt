Okay, here's a detailed trip plan from Kolkata to Chennai, incorporating historical sightseeing, cultural experiences, budget considerations (around $1000 USD), and the resources you're interested in.  I'll break it down into sections and provide specific links and suggestions.

*   **Travel Style:** Comfortable but budget-conscious. We'll prioritize value-for-money options.

*   **Flights:** Flight prices are HIGHLY variable.  I'll give an *estimated* cost based on online searches today, but you *must* check current prices on travel websites and adjust the budget accordingly.
*   **Hotel Prices:** Similar to flights, hotel prices fluctuate.  I'll provide estimated ranges, but you should check specific dates on hotel booking platforms.
*   **Food:**  Chennai offers incredible food at all price points.  I'll factor in a reasonable daily food budget that allows for both street food and occasional restaurant meals.
*   **Activities & Entrance Fees:**  Entrance fees to historical sites are generally quite low in India.  I'll allocate a small amount for these.
*   **Transportation within Chennai:** Mostly using auto-rickshaws, buses, and possibly ride-sharing apps (Ola, Uber).
