Okay, here's a possible itinerary for a trip from Chennai to Kerala with a focus on history, culture, food, and using travel resources, all while staying within a $1000 budget.  This itinerary assumes you're traveling for about 7 days/6 nights and traveling as a single person or a couple (since $1000 for a larger group would be quite tight).  Prices are estimates and can fluctuate wildly depending on the time of year and availability.  Book in advance, especially for flights and accommodation!
